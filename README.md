solat.fish

A simple script to display solat times for Johor Bahru, Malaysia. It uses the API from https://mpt.i906.my/api.html 
For other regions, kindly use the location codes from https://mpt.i906.my/code.html

Also, it displays the current Hijri date using the API from https://aladhan.com/islamic-calendar-api#get-/gToHCalendar/-month-/-year-

I did this because I'm on the terminal most of the time and I would rather not use widgets and such.

whatismyip.fish

A script to display Local IP address, IPv4 and IPv6 addreses.
