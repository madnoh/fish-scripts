### solat.fish

A simple script to display solat times for Johor Bahru, Malaysia. It uses the API from https://mpt.i906.my/api.html 
For other regions in Malaysia, kindly refer to https://mpt.i906.my/code.html

Also, it displays the current Hijri date using the API from https://aladhan.com/islamic-calendar-api#get-/gToHCalendar/-month-/-year-
